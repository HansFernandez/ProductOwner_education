#### The Scrum Guide defines product owner as:

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

```
The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:
  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
  - Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
  - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.
  ```


The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.
The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.
For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.


#### Personal Takeaways:

  - PO owns the return on investment and the value of the product
  - Context matters; company, team and product will dictate how to reach those goals. Adaptability is therefore a favorable trait 
  - Deep understanding of customer base is necessary to have a relentless pursuit of high ROI and product value
  - Daily conversations and clear communications are key for backlog transperency and clarity
  - PO will colloborate with Development team and other but is ultimately the final decision maker for backlog 
  - Respect from entire organization is absolutely necessary for success and backlog management
  - The PO executes on the product vision
  - The PO can be seen as CEO of Product
  - PO is responsible for why and how

#### Techniques
  - PO should embed themselves in customer community to understand market/end-user needs
  - Learn about the relevant technologies 

The above are Goals and a new Product Owner may not achieve all these marks. It is imperative they strive meet theses defined roles.
