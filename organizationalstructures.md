## What happens when the product is too large for a single product owner?



1.	Create a Hierarchical Product Owner Structure

  A chief product owner, who owns entire product, with team level product owners. Chief PO manages long term vision over many quarters or years, certain types of stakeholders, and defines what ROI is. Team product owners then work within the parameters set by chief. Multiple layers may be added if needed.

2.	The Spotify Tribe Engineering Model

  This method does not involve hierarchy. Squads are created (think SCRUM team) but are not doing scrum methodology but are practicing AGILE. Multiple squads are placed into a tribe. The product owner of different squads collaborate and maintain a high level road-map document that shows where Spotify as a whole is heading and each PO is responsible for maintaining a matching product backlog for their squad. 

  Note: No Hierarchy; Just direct point to point communication between all PO. Spotify Product Owners collaborate on a road map. There is no senior Product Owner

3. Large Scale SCRUM (LeSS) Product Owner Structure

	Expands SCRUM concepts beyond immediate team level. Main PO is responsible for backlog. Then there are Area Product Owner who are responsible for small pieces of product backlog for particular teams. Backlog is basically divided into 'areas' and APO focus on those areas to advance.

	" Product Owner Team-- The APOs and the PO together form a team-- the Product Owner Team. This team makes product-wide prioritization decisions, but the PO always has final decision. Also, scope and schedule decisions stay with the PO-- they decide when to release what."
