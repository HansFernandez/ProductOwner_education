## Anti-Patterns for the Product Owner

An anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.

Below are some identified anti-patterns to avoid:

1.  Do not focus on "how" and "when" rather than "what" and the "why"

	For example, a PO that specifies which SQL table to store a piece of information may be focusing on a How v. a what. This is a technical decision that is better suited for Development team to address. A pattern that sometimes occurs is a Development nervous or scared of making technical decisions because they may be blamed later on. They push that responsibility onto the PO as a scapegoat. Work with SCRUM master and managers to improve and change the culture; ultimately this is what leads to a high performing organization.

2. Remember PO cannot push scope into releases

	You don't get to decide what scope is going to be ready by what date. You CAN decide when the product is ready to be released. Respect the team capacity to put in work. Don't push work onto the team.

3. Do not act like a Product Manager 

	Do not focus on scope, schedule and budget. PO should always focus on value. They should relentlessly focus on value from customers perspective. Successful products are high value products not one finished on time and on budget. 

4. Do not focus on internal stakeholders instead of paying customers

Create an intimate connection with end-users. Customers write checks!

Great product owners focus relentlessly on the customer experience.

	   “If there’s one reason we have done better than our peers in the Internet space over the last six years, it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience, and that really does matter, I think, in any business.” — Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com

Product Owners are responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
