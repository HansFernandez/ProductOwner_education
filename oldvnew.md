## Comparing Old School and New school approaches

[Embed image here]

### Old School: Market

No where is there a close interaction between PO and development team. It used to be thinking in a room and planning.


* Market Problems: Interview customers with surveys
* Competitive Landscape: Identify strengths and weaknesses of alternatives and competitors.
* Asset Assessment: Inventory your strengths
* The above are all MBS mindset

Old School: Focus

* Distribution Strategy: Determine channels
* Product Portfolio: Manage multiple products in a coherent way
* Product Roadmap: Define phases of the product

Old School: Business

* Pricing: Decide by inelasticity of Market
* Buy, Build or Partner: decide on the product development approach


Old School: Planning

* Position: "Create internal positioning documents..."
	* Reflects internal work rather than customer contact
* User personas: Define archetypes of customers
	* Heavy handed and without feedback loop
* Stakeholder communication: Decide how to share progress with internal stakeholders


### New School!

 * "Forget this idea of calculating business value. Those are just made up numbers" -David Anderson
 * Everything is a hypothesis -- pushing for quick product testing
 * The market decides the fate
 	* Internal influences and opinions do not matter(Even from senior VP); You discover the truth in value by producing things and going out to real world and evaluating them.
* Speed wins
	* He who learns fastest wins!

New School: The Model - Lean Startup

Lean> Build> Measure --- The speed with which you can go through this loop is all that matters.

Build does NOT mean building a product. It means create minimal prototype/test/question necessary to learn. Includes conversation, landing page, Google Ad, prototype, etc.

Experiment Definitions for LEAN Startup Model

1. An experiment has a hypothesis that can be validated or invalidated
    - Not a hypothesis: We'll try something and see what happens
			- Not objective and quantitative
    - Not a hypothesis: People think that their clothes don't fit
		- Hypothesis: 8/10 Women who shopped online in the past month bought at least one item that did not fit.

2. An experiment has an experimental method which can be replicated
    - We're going to the mall and talk to a few people.
			- Unclear and unspecific
			- PO are often very enthusiastic about customer, problem and solution; Self deception can lead PO astray.  
		- Experimental method: We will approach the first ten people we see carrying items of clothing and ask them the following questions..

3. An experiment is reversible ...
    - Not reversible: We will spend 18 mos. and 3M building a solution and see what happens
		- reversible: We will create a lightweight prototype, time boxed to a day or two and see if anyone clicks this button.

### Design thinking

* Empathize with customer
* Define the issues
* Go wide and engage divergent thinking
* prototype
* Test

Case Study: Travelocity

Travelocity provided Hotel, Air and car fare separately. They wanted to explore bundling items together. They created a budget in website that read "Hotel + Air" that would lead to the error page. They time boxed it for a week and would analyze the amount of clicks/visits the button received to see whether or not offering bundling was a good idea.

# Validate an Idea with the Validation Board

Step 1: What is  your vision ?
Step 2: What is your first customer and problem hypothesis?
Step 3: What are the assumptions?
Step 4: What is your riskiest assumption, method, and min. success criterion ?
Step 5: Was your assumption validated or invalidated?
Step 6: Do you pivot or continue ?
