In this small article the author relays Reid Hoffman's (Co-founder of LinkedIn) opinion on what skills product-focused founders should posess. Hoffman lists the three primary skills as design, enginerring and product management. Hoffman pushes bakc against the idea that a product-founder needs to be a programmer. Althought he admits it is a strength it is not an area where large focus is needed. 


Hoffman continued, stating that a product-focused founder doesn't necessarily need all three, although that is helpful. What's really necessary, though, is to be very strong in at least one of those, and being willing to learn.

Which is what Hoffman did over time, with one key lesson he picked up being that "if you’re not embarassed by your first product release, you released too late."

Teams that Lead, Innovate, and Succeed
Featured Guest: Deborah Ancona, MIT Sloan School of Management professor and coauthor of X-Teams: How to Build Teams that Lead, Innovate, and Succeed.

This article is about leading teams and seems to touch on a few Agile conepts wihtout mentioning them by name 

Why do good teams fail?

After analyzing several succesful teams Deborah proposes there are 2 parts to every great team: Internal Processes and External procesess

Deborah posits that teams increase good internal team dynamics with external activity. We don’t want a team to build a wall between itself and the external environment. You want a team to be able to adapt. You want a team to be able to innovate. 

 " For example, one of our consulting teams that we studied for the book was asked to go into their districts and to come up with best practices or new interventions. But because the team leader said, well, first, we have to focus inward, building trust and camaraderie within the team, they did not go into their districts. When they were then asked by the president of the company to say, what are your suggestions? They had very, very poor results."
Therefore, the X method should be used to achieve high levels of innovation.


## The "X-Team" method outlined:
         -- External activity
             -- Scouting 
               -- Changes in technology, marketplace, competition,company culture analysis
             -- Ambassodrship
               -- Understanding the strategic direction of the company[or subsection] and representing the team’s needs up and down the hierarchy.
             -- Coordination
               -- identifying core interdependencies within the organization, or even outside the organization, and managing those. Motivating those people, creating shared work plans, cajoling folks so that those external people help the team to get its job done.
         -- Extreme Execution
             -- good internal process
                        --Example: Building trust around common goals; working on how a team can best organize itself to get the job done
         -- Flexible Method
           -- Exploration exportation 
                 -- Gathers ideas, moving to a core idea/product; Identified product is placed into organization

X Teams help an organization to innovate better by collecting data from external sources and distills those ideas and then does so continously. 

## Create an X-Team:
   -- Staffing 
     -- staff people who are compatible with each other or who brought necessary expertise. 
     -- pulling in people who have the right external networks and connections who can help the team to connect to the external environment.
     --  give teams the structure and support and feedback that they need to be effective over time.
          -- Set milestones for activities to move forward. 
     --Top management support. Without it ideas become repetitive and teams incentives falls. Empowerment and support also necessat for this reason



## X Teams: Distributed Leadership and Action

Leadership does not only exist at the top of an organization.

Distributed leaders allow the spread of the work in understanding the environment, creating a vision of where theorganization and the team can go within that environment, and creating a set of motivated andcommitted people who will make the ideas of a team into a reality.
