## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Planning Theory (https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)



> The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. **This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.**

>Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

>Sprint Planning answers the following:
* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?


#### Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. **The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal.**  The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

**The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog,** the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

During Sprint Planning the **Scrum Team** also crafts a Sprint Goal. **The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.**

#### Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done ?

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. **The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.**

The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.

**The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner.**  The Development Team may also invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice.

**By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.**


#### Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. **The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.** The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology. **If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.**

### Practices

### What can be delivered during a sprint?

* Standard approach: Calculate based on story points.
* Total number of points is called velocity and velocity is used to plan sprint
  * This takes 15 minutes if everything is ready prior to Sprint Planning
* Pro approach: Use historical throughput data to create forecast; no estimate needed.
  * Look up refinement model for more information
* Intermediate approach: Recognize variance
  * Use the focusedobjectives.com "Basic Statistics Worksheet"
  * Standard look at points and averages; no room for variance
  * **Remember, the Development Team decides the work taken into the Sprint**
